/**
 * 一个可能异步计算的阶段，当另一个CompletionStage完成时，该阶段将执行操作或计算值。
 * 一个阶段在其计算终止时完成，但是这又可能触发其他依赖的阶段。
 * 此接口中定义的功能仅采用几种基本形式，这些形式扩展为一大套方法，以捕获各种使用样式：
 *
 *     1.根据阶段是否需要参数和/或产生结果，可以将阶段执行的计算表示为Function，Consumer或Runnable（对应使用名称包括apply，accept或run的方法）。
 * 例如，stage.thenApply(x -> square(x)).thenAccept(x -> System.out.print(x)).thenRun(() -> System.out.println())。另一种形式（compose）使用阶段本身的功能，而不是其结果。
 *
 *     2.一个阶段的执行可以由一个阶段的完成、或两个阶段的完成、或两个阶段之一的完成来触发。
 * 对单个阶段的依赖被使用带有前缀then的方法来安排。
 * 由两个阶段都完成而触发的新阶段，该新阶段可能使用对应的命名方法来组合两个旧阶段的结果或者效果。
 * 由两个阶段中的任何一个完成而触发的新阶段，不能保证使用两个旧阶段中的哪个的结果或效果来进行自己的计算。
 *
 *     3.阶段之间的依赖关系控制着计算的触发，但不能保证任何特定的顺序。
 * 此外，新阶段计算的执行可以通过以下三种方式安排：默认执行，默认异步执行（使用带有后缀async的方法，该方法采用该阶段的默认异步执行工具）或自定义（通过提供的Executor）。
 * 默认模式和异步模式的执行属性由CompletionStage实现而不是此接口指定。
 * 具有显式Executor参数的方法可能具有任意执行属性，甚至可能不支持并发执行，但被安排为以适应异步的方式进行处理。
 *
 *     4.无论触发的新阶段是正常完成还是异常完成，有两种方法形式支持继续处理：
 * 方法whenComplete允许不考虑结果而注入动作，否则将结果保留在whenComplete完成时。
 * 方法handle还允许该阶段计算替换结果，该替换结果可以使其他依赖阶段进行进一步处理。
 * 在所有其他情况下，如果阶段的计算由于（未经检查的）异常或错误而突然终止，
 * 那么所有需要该阶段完成的依赖阶段也会异常地完成，并且CompletionException将异常作为其原因。
 * 如果一个阶段依赖于两个阶段，且这两个阶段都异常地完成，则新阶段抛出的CompletionException可能对应于两个老阶段抛出的异常之一。
 * 如果一个阶段依赖于两个阶段中的任何一个，并且两个阶段其中只有一个异常完成，则不能保证依赖的阶段是正常完成还是异常完成。
 * 在方法whenComplete的情况下，如果提供的操作本身遇到异常，则该阶段将以该异常地异常完成（如果尚未异常完成）。
 *
 * 所有方法都遵循上述触发，执行和特殊的完成规范（在各个方法规范中不再重复）。
 * 此外，虽然用于传递完成结果的方法（即，对于T类型的参数）的参数可能为null，但为任何其他参数传递null值将导致抛出NullPointerException。
 *
 * 该接口未定义用于初始创建、强制正常或异常完成、探测完成状态或结果、或等待阶段完成的方法。
 * CompletionStage的实现可以酌情提供实现这种效果的方法。
 * 方法toCompletableFuture（）通过提供通用的转换类型来实现此接口的不同实现之间的互操作性。
