/**
 * 可重入互斥{@link Lock}具有与使用{@code synchronized}方法和语句访问的隐式monitor锁相同的基本行为和语义，
 * 但提供了扩展功能。
 *
 * <p>一个{@code ReentrantLock}是被最后一次成功加锁，但是还没有解锁的线程拥有。
 * 当锁不属于其他线程时，调用{@code lock}的线程将返回，并成功获取锁。
 * 如果当前线程已经拥有锁，则该方法将立即返回。
 * 可以使用方法{@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}和{@link #getHoldCount}进行检查。
 *
 * <p>这个类的构造函数接受一个可选的<em>公平性(fairness)</em>参数。
 * 当设置{@code true}时，在争用状态下，锁倾向于授予对最长等待线程的访问权。否则，此锁不保证任何特定的访问顺序。
 * 使用多个线程访问的公平锁的程序比那些使用默认设置的程序可能会显示较低的总体吞吐量(通常要慢得多)，但是在获得锁和保证不会锁饥饿（注：长时间等待的线程始终获取不到锁）方面的时间差异更小。
 * 但是请注意，锁的公平性并不保证线程调度的公平性。因此，使用公平锁的多个线程中的一个可能会连续多次获得它，而其他活动线程没有进展，当前也没有持有锁。
 *
 * <p>还要注意，不定时的{@link #tryLock()}方法不遵循公平性设置。如果锁可用，即使其他线程正在等待，它也会成功。
 *
 * <p>推荐的做法是<em>总是</em>在调用{@code lock}后紧接着一个{@code try}块，最典型的是在一个before/after construction，如:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 *
 * <p>除了实现{@link Lock}接口外，该类还定义了许多{@code public}和{@code protected}方法来检查锁的状态。
 * 其中一些方法仅对检测和监视有用。
 *
 * <p>序列化这个类的行为与内置锁的行为相同:反序列化锁处于解锁状态，无论它在序列化时的状态如何。
 *
 * <p>此锁支持同一线程最多2147483647( 注：由于底层用AQS state来表示锁的持有数，state定义为int，最大值就是2^31 -1)递归加锁。
 *  试图超过此限制将导致{@link Error}从锁定方法抛出。
