/**
 * 与使用{@code synchronized}方法和语句相比，{@code Lock}锁实现提供了更广泛的锁操作。
 * 它们允许更灵活的结构，可以具有完全不同的属性，并且可以支持多个关联的{@link Condition} 对象。
 *
 * <p> 锁是一种用于控制多个线程对共享资源访问的工具。
 *  通常，锁提供对共享资源的独占访问：一次只能有一个线程可以获取该锁，而对共享资源的所有访问都需要首先获取该锁。
 *  但是，某些锁可能允许并发访问共享资源，例如{@link ReadWriteLock}的读取锁。
 *
 * <p>使用{@code synchronized}方法或语句可访问与每个对象关联的隐式monitor锁，
 *  但会强制所有锁的获取和释放以块结构的方式发生：
 *  当获取多个锁时，它们必须以相反的顺序释放，并且所有锁必须在与获得这些锁的相同词法作用域内释放。
 *
 *  <p> 尽管用于{@code synchronized}方法和语句的作用域机制让使用monitor锁的编程变得更加容易，
 *  并有助于避免许多常见的涉及锁的编程错误，但在某些情况下，你需要以更灵活的方式使用锁。
 *  例如，某些用于遍历并发访问的数据结构的算法需要使用“hand-over-hand”或“chain locking”：
 *  你获取节点A的锁，然后获取节点B的锁，然后释放A并获取C，然后释放B并获得D等。
 *  Lock接口的实现通过允许在不同范围内获取和释放锁，并允许以任意顺序获取和释放多个锁，从而启用了此类技术。
 *
 *  <p>灵活性的提高带来了更多的责任。
 *  缺少块结构锁定将消除{@code synchronized}方法和语句相关的自动锁定释放。
 *  在大多数情况下，应使用以下惯用法：
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * Lock l = ...;
 * l.lock();
 * try {
 *   // access the resource protected by this lock
 * } finally {
 *   l.unlock();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
 * taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
 * held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
 * lock is released when necessary.
 *
 * <p>{@code Lock} implementations provide additional functionality
 * over the use of {@code synchronized} methods and statements by
 * providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
 * #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
 * interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
 * the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code Lock} class can also provide behavior and semantics
 * that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
 * such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
 * detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
 * then the implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code Lock} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement.
 * Acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a {@code Lock} instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Lock}
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any
 * parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being
 * thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
 *
 * <p>All {@code Lock} implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
 * lock, as described in
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
 * The Java Language Specification (17.4 Memory Model)</a>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A successful {@code lock} operation has the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a successful <em>Lock</em> action.
 * <li>A successful {@code unlock} operation has the same
 * memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>Unlock</em> action.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
 * synchronization effects.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 *
 * <p>The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
 * characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
 * qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
 * acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given {@code Lock}
 * class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
 * exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
 * lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
 * ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
 * defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
 * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
 * method entry.
 *
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
